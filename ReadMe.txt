The GMS2 configurations are currently compiled in Visual Studio 2010 with the
2008 (vc90) toolset.  The GMS1 configuration is compiled in Visual Studio
2003.

The 64-bit configurations require libraries in the SerialEMLibs repository,
available at http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/SerialEMLibs.  This repository
should be in an adjacent directory, unless the properties are changed to
access the libraries from another location.

These libraries include version 3 of the FFTW libraries, which are Copyright

and Steven G. Johnson, and covered by the GPL license.  Other libraries are
shared with SerialEM and their license terms are described in the SerialEM
Copyright.txt file.
